# Agario

Simplified version of the popular Agario game. The objective is to eat as much food from the play area while avoiding blobs that are bigger than you and eating blobs smaller than you.

The initial code was inspired by the Coding train coding challenge. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjVyKXp9hec)
