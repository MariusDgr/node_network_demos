# Demo mini projects for learning node server and sockets

### Dependencies

Node.js and npm are needed.

### Installation guide
The repo contains multiple demo miniprojects.

Navigate into one of the subfolders. If there is no folder named "node_modules" but there is a "package.json" file, open a terminal and run:

~~~
node install
~~~

This will download the needed modules as they are specified in the "package.json" file.

### Usage
Navigate into one of the folders. If a "server.js" file is present, then a server needs to be run in order to play the multiplayer version.

Open a terminal and run:

~~~
node server
~~~

Then you can open the "index.html" file in different browser instances and these instances will communicate through the server that we have started. Good luck and have fun!
